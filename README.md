## ðŸ“„ VisionFlow Extractor
VisionFlow Extractor is a full-stack web application designed to automate the process of extracting structured data from invoice images. A user can upload an invoice, and the application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the document and a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently parse and extract key information like vendor name, dates, and total amount.
This project was built to demonstrate a modern, end-to-end workflow using Python for the backend, React for the frontend, and various AI/ML tools for the core logic.
